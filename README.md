### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Spring Security JWT**
- **Description:**  
  Implements authentication and authorization using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.  
  Users can log in, receive a JWT token, and use it to access secured endpoints.

- **Key Features:**
    - **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used to verify user authentication.
    - **Token Structure:**
        - **Header**: Contains token type (`JWT`) and signing algorithm.
        - **Payload**: Includes user claims (like roles and permissions).
        - **Signature**: Ensures the integrity of the token.
    - **Why Use JWT?**
        - Secure and scalable authentication.
